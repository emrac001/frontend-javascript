# Task 0 - TypeScript: Creating an Interface for a Student

## Project Overview
This task is part of the **0x04-TypeScript** project.  
The objective is to practice the basics of **TypeScript interfaces, arrays, and DOM manipulation**.  

I created an interface Student, built a small dataset of students, and used Vanilla JavaScript (compiled from TypeScript) to dynamically render a table in the DOM.

  - Defines the Student interface
  - Creates two student objects

  - Dynamically creates a table with each student's firstName and location
